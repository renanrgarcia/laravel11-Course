# Validations
- It's possible to implement the validation rules in the controller, but it's not recommended
- `php artisan make:request <className>`
  - Creates a new validation class
  - Class name pattern: ActionnameResourceRequest. Ex: StoreUserRequest
  - Creates on the `app/Http/Requests` folder
- On the class:
  - Change the return on the `authorize` method to `true`
  - Create a array on the return of the `rules` method to add the validation rules
    - Ex:
    ```php
    return [ 
      'name' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
    ];
    ```
