# Components
- Components are reusable views
- `php artisan make:component <componentName>`
- You also can add a component inside resources/views/components
  - For example alert.blade.php
    ```blade php
    @if (session('message'))
        <div class="alert alert-success">
    @endif
    ```
  - To use the component in a blade file, you can use:
    - <x-alert/> <!-- Blade component tag to call the component -->
    or 
    - @include('components.alert') <!-- Includes the contents of another view -->
- To adjust the tailwind configuration, go to resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php
  - Copy and paste the following code on <head> of the "base".blade.php
  ```php
  @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])
  ```
