# MVC
- MVC is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected parts.
  - Model - data
  - View - user interface
  - Controller - application logic

# Routes
- You can define routes in the "routes/web.php" file
  - Ex: 
  `Route::get('/', function () {`
    `return view('welcome');`
  `});`
- Routes can return controllers. Ex: 
  `Route::get('/users', [UserController::class, 'index'])->name('users.index');` // users.index is the alias for the route. It is a default name

# Controllers
- `php artisan make:controller <folder>/<fileController>`: creates a new controller
  - The controller will be in `app/Http/Controllers`
  - You can add a function to the controller
    - Ex: 
    `public function index() {`
      `return view(admin.users.index, compact('users'));` // can be a view or a redirect
    `}`

# Models
- `php artisan make:model <folder>/<fileModel>`: creates a new model
  - The model will be in `app/Models`

# Views
- `php artisan make:view <folder>/<fileView>`: creates a new view
  - The view will be in `resources/views`
